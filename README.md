# Batch-Files

### Change the required things inside the files to make it useful for you.

## Clear_Files.bat
My first batch file program, to delete files, its simple and stupid.
To run the file, run the file with the following command in command prompt or double click the file.

```
> Clear_Files
```

## Change_IP.bat
In my university, we had to swith our IP Settings to access the internet, stupid thing. When we had to use your personal hotspot, we had to remove all the IP Settings, another stupid thing. So, I made this batch script to make it switch in single click.
